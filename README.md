# Li-AutoRepair

Li-AutoRepair is a World of Warcraft addon that repairs your gear automatically when you open a window with a repair merchant.

First it will attempt to repair using guild funds, if that doesn't work, it will repair using personal funds.
If it was successful it will tell you what your calculated durability was and how much gold it costed you.

_That's it! There is nothing to configure. You install the addon and it just works as described above!_
